                    <h1>Alison Clementi</h1>
                    <p>I grew up in Southern New Jersey across the river from Philadelphia. There is a lot of history in this area and I
                    developed a profound love for all things history. This led me to become a History major at Indiana University of
                    Pennsylvania where I earned a Bachelor of Art degree in History with a minor in Homeland Security. My studies in
                    homeland security prompted an interest in cybersecurity so after graduation, I enrolled in Camden County College. I had
                    to take a mandatory Python programming class, which piqued an interest in web development. These educational experiences
                    exposed me to so many things that I enjoy learning about. I am a continuous learner. I enjoy reading, researching,
                    analyzing, presenting and talking about what I learned. I look forward to starting a career where I can continuously
                    learn and help the company I work for reach their goals.
